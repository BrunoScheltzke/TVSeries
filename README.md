### Code

- I have used the MVVM architecture. I chose this architecture as it's easy to use/understand, fast to develop and it's very scalable.
- All ViewModels are abstracted by protocols so it's easy to mock for unit testing (not included in the project)
- The ViewModels are injected in the viewcontroller through their init constructor. In order to make that happen, no storyboard was used.
- I don't have a dog in the xib/viewcoding fight. I like them both equally üòÖ. I think xibs are more visual while view coding makes it much better to code review.
- As I was doing this challenge alone and with limited time I decided to go with Xib files but I'm very familiar with ViewCode as well.
- Project includes a centralized APIService class with a function that uses Generics.
- Image caching is being accomplished by the ImageManager class (with protocol abstraction).
